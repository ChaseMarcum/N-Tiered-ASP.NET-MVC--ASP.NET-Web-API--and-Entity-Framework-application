Junior Project - N-Tiered application
=======================================================================

N-Tiered ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and Entity Framework application

I took on the role of Team Lead in Oregon Techâ€™s three term Junior Team Project in Software Process Management, Design, and Implementation, where we utilized the Agile and Scrum software development process to gather requirements, model, analyze, develop and integrate our n-tiered architecture product. In the project we developed a prototype, delivered a complete Pre Plan Documentation, and delivered a total of three iterations of our product with updated documentation.

Our team was given the scenario that a company selected us to create an automated job application system.  During the Pre Planning process we gathered requirements, modeled, analyze, and created Project Notebook that some of the documents included the Project Plan, Requirements, Domain Model, Storyboards, Architecture Plan, and QA Plan.  Throughout the project out Project Notebook was updated as needed, including weekly Status Reports.

Our first Iteration we developed the database schema in SQL, deployed the database into Azure SQL, developed a WCF Service, developed an ASP.NET MVC administrative website with the functionality to create/edit/delete users and job objects, and developed the UI for the administrative website.  We established a Git repository for our source control, used Google Drive to collaborate on documents, and used Skype to communicate outside of our in person meetings.

In Iteration 2 we developed an ASP.NET MVC client application website with the UI and functionality to select a region at the start of the application, a view to display open jobs by region and their detail views, an application view, a separate WCF Service for the client website, and Unit Tests for services and controllers.  Continued to utilize Git, Google Drive, and Skype for group collaboration.

In our final Integration 3 we had to redesign and recreate our Services.  In the redesign we developed ASP.NET Web API Services to replace the initial WCF Services, developed a JavaScript testing tool for the service, then deployed and published the services in Azure Cloud Services and Azure Storage.  We completed the functionality for the client application website, implemented user login permissions for the administrative site, added additional features to the administrative website, then deployed and published both websites in Azure Web.
